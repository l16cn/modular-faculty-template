\item {\bf Advisors}: \gls{vv} and \gls{gi} (Operations Research)
%\item {\bf Dissertation}: Multi-agent control in sociotechnical systems 
\smallskip
\item Specialized in managing systemic risk and
modeling social dynamics %research 
via systems engineering and \gls{ai} %artificial intelligence
\item %Modeled 
Developed a control-theoretic %crowd %\gls{dm} dynamics 
\gls{od} model, %based on control theory
validated via human-subject experiments
\item Developed an 
optimal control--based %feedback 
%mechanism 
framework for %crowd \gls{dm}
%improving efficiency of 
improving multi-stakeholder %policy-making
\gls{dm}
%to improve its efficiency
%applicable to policy-making
%feedback mechanisms %to %improve crowd \gls{dm}

%for better 
%to improve efficiency
\item Developed an open data--driven, %data-driven 
early-warning system to predict and prevent mining accidents 
%based on 
%open data
%dynamics of crowds
%Modeled collective dynamics of %multiple 
%interacting and intelligent agents using control theory
%\item Designed %control-theoretic 
%%soft 
%feedback mechanisms to %that could 
%improve \gls{dm} efficiency for %of
%intelligent groups %of intelligent individuals
%%make intelligent crowds ``smarter''
\item Developed an %Modeled 
income distribution model
using 
statistical mechanics and population game theory %, and open data %Discovered deep connections through game theory between income inequality and thermodynamics
%\item Conducted behavioral research experiments %on social influence 
%with human subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk
\item %Conducted systemic risk research 
Developed systemic financial risk models
%Collaborated 
with %both 
%world-class scholars and 
executives %-level practitioners
from Prudential Finance and PNC Bank
 %on systemic risk research
\item Developed %Implemented 
an agent-based model to understand 
high-frequency trading and its market impact
\item %Systematically 
Identified 
%Applied process hazard analysis %(signed digraph) 
%techniques

vulnerabilities in financial networks
%systematically
using process hazard analysis techniques
%\item Worked with Prudential %Financial 
%%on 
%to develop a risk measure
%based on financial statements

%\item Managed website and assisted in organizing three university-level symposia and workshops
\item Led multiple  
interdisciplinary research projects and
supervised graduate and undergraduate teams
