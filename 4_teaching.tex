\paragraph{Teaching Techniques} %There are many techniques either I fortunately have benefited from as a student 
%or used in my past teaching experience
%that I hope to bring to my classroom.
%They would focus different aspects of managing a class,
%i.e.,~motivation, participation, and practice.

%Celebrating diversity %creates a vibrant collection of 
%%ensures that 
%is necessary for the emergence of
%%characteristics, opinions, and wisdoms
%%where
% new ideas and breakthroughs.
%As a music composer myself, I will %hope to %would manage my research group like %at \sch{} like %conducting an orchestra---%
%manage my classroom like
%the conductor of 
%conducting an orchestra---%
%creating consonance among students from different backgrounds %different individuals
%and embracing the ensemble of unique experiences and opinions.
%It is crucial to promote an inclusive environment because
%everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn and to participate.
%%Having lived in New York City, 
%%I always experience inclusion regardless of
%%my race or sexual orientation.
%%Not everyone, however, is as fortunate. %as me.
%It is my responsibility as a faculty %and an instructor therefore 
%%would be
%%to welcome students from different backgrounds and
%%ensure that no one 
%to ensure that students feel included and treated equally.
%I would go the extra mile to know my students
%and reach out to those who do not participate because 
%they fear being judged.
%%I would be happy to participate in the hiring process, to reach out to underrepresented groups, 
%%and to defend equality on campus.
%I believe that a diverse and inclusive climate benefits the efficient learning of students.

\section*{Teaching %Chemical 
Engineering Courses}
%\ins{snippets/teaching_course}

%I would readily teach any course offered in the core chemical engineering curriculum
%%(preferably courses relevant to my research, e.g.,~control, maths, safety, and design),
%as well as technical electives %in programming, data science, 
%%intelligent process systems, etc.
%that are related to my research interests and of practical importance to chemical engineering students.
